    "- **Loaded the data**: Started by loading the student data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "- **Displayed the original records**: Printed out the original student records to ensure the data was loaded correctly.\n",
    "- **Sorted the data**: Sorted the DataFrame by profession in ascending order and by score in descending order.\n",
    "- **Displayed the sorted data**: Printed the sorted student data to see how it was organized.\n",
    "- **Initialized the groups**: Decided to create three groups and set up empty lists for each one.\n",
    "- **Distributed the students**: For each unique profession, filtered the students and distributed them into the groups using a round-robin method.\n",
    "- **Calculated the averages**: Created a function to calculate the average score for each group.\n",
    "- **Calculated the standard deviation**: Found the initial standard deviation of the group averages to check how spread out they were.\n",
    "- **Displayed the initial distribution**: Printed the initial distribution of students in each group, along with their average scores and the standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Swapped students**: Defined a function to minimize the standard deviation by swapping students between groups.\n",
    "  - Identified which group had the highest average score and which one had the lowest.\n",
    "  - Swapped the highest-scoring student from the high group with the lowest-scoring student from the low group, focusing on students with the same profession.\n",
    "- **Attempted improvement**: Called the swap function to see if it improved the group averages and standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Displayed the updated distribution**: Printed the updated distribution of students in each group and the new standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Compared the results**: Showed both the initial and final standard deviations to see how much improvement was made.\n"
